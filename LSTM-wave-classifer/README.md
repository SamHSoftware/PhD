## Description: 
- This code is designed to train an LSTM based machine learning model to classify single-feature time series data related to my PhD. 
- The data in question will not be extensivly described here until the publishing of this work. Thus, certain references to the data may seem vague unless you are working within our research group. 
- The model is constructed using the Pytorch package.
- For each python file, there is a .ipynb file for those who use JupyterLab.
- The code will provide a number of outputs, including the trained model, and a list of the excel files which correspond to class '1' data. 

## Here's how to unit test the code before using it:
