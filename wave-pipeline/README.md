## Description:   
- This computational pipeline is designed to handle data pertaining to my PhD research. This data will not be extensively described here, as the work is currently unpublished. Nonetheless, the indivudal components of this pipeline may be useful to anyone wishing to automate the analysis of cell biology microscopy images. Should anyone wish to continue my research, this pipeline will be essential. 
- This pipeline processes microscopy data gathered by the Yokogawa CV7000S microscope. 
- The microscopy data contains images of cell nuclei, expressing fluorescent markers in 3 different channels (one to stain the nucleus, and two reporters of biological activity). 
- The pipeline extracts this fluorescence data, processes it, and outputs graphical and numerical data for further analysis.
