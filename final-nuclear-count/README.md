# Description: 
- This module is designed to take .xlsx data of the number of nuclei within a colony per microscopy timepoint. 
- The purpose of this code is to consider a folder of .xlsx file (each representing a colony), and take the final number of nuclei within each colony. Finally, the code simply makes a new excel file containing these values.
- I have included .py files and .ipynb files for those who use JupyterLab.
